### Project Overview

#### Auction Website Frontend
This project is the frontend part of an auction website, designed using React. It allows users to participate in auctions, either by bidding on items or by listing their own items for auction. The frontend interacts with a backend (not included in this documentation) for data handling and storage.

### Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone [Repository URL]
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Navigate to the project directory and run:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Running the Application:**
   Start the application in development mode:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

### File Structure and Components Overview

- `App.js`: The main entry point of the application. It sets up the React Router and global state management.
- `BidOnAuction.jsx`: Manages the bidding process, allowing users to place bids on auction items.
- `AuctionsList.jsx`: Displays a list of all available auctions, with options to view details of each auction.
- `AddAuction.jsx`: Enables users to add new auction items, providing details like item name, description, and starting bid.
- `Welcome.jsx`: A welcome screen or landing page that introduces users to the website.
- `Dockerfile`: Contains the setup for containerizing the application, making it easy to deploy.

### Usage and Features

- **Bidding on Auctions:** Users can view active auctions and place bids.
- **Listing Auction Items:** Users can list new items for auction, setting the initial bid and item details.
- **Auction Management:** View and manage ongoing and past auctions.
- **Responsive Design:** The website is designed to be responsive, ensuring a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Dependencies

Key dependencies from `package.json` include:
- `react`: Library for building the user interface.
- `axios`: For making HTTP requests to the backend API.
- Other dependencies include various React hooks and utilities, as well as styling libraries.

### Dockerization

The `Dockerfile` provided in the project allows for containerization of the application, facilitating easy deployment and scaling. It specifies the base image, environment setup, and the commands to run the application.

### Extensibility

The components are designed with extensibility in mind. They are modular and can be easily modified or extended to include additional features like advanced auction management, user profiles, and more detailed item descriptions.
